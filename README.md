# Deep Learning Challenge

## Data Preprocssing

### What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model? 
"Is Successful"

### What variable(s) are the features for your model?
Application Type, Income Amount, Special Considerations, Ask Amount

### What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
EIN, Name



## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

### How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
neurons: 43
layers:2
activation functions: 1 (relu)


### Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
No, the first pass of the model achieved an accuracy of 0.725 with a loss of 0.554. 

### What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Increase number of hidden layers, changing of activation function. Unfortunately I was only able to increase accuracy to 0.736 with a loss of 0.544.
